    As web developers, we depend on network protocols to ensure the products

    Understanding the things that happen between physical signals on the wire
    and your web application will help you hone your craft and level you up.

    with a little guidance. So let's walk together through these concepts,
    and peel away the layers of the network stack one by one.
